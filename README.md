# Hello!

My name is Brayden Zee. I am currently a student planning to study computer
science in college. I publish almost all of my work to GitHub in order to keep
a record of the progress I have made over time.

## Notable Projects

- [robotrs](https://github.com/BlueZeeKing/robotrs) - a port of the majority of the core [WPILib](https://wpilib.org/) to the Rust programming language
- [factions](https://github.com/ickerio/factions) - a Minecraft mod I am a maintainer of after I added features I wanted and made a pull request with them
- [ocebot-code-2024](https://github.com/Ocebots/ocebot-code-2024) - the source code for FRC team 9033. I wrote the majority of this code, and this is the first time I used and understood PID and feedforward control.
- [aoc-2023](https://github.com/BlueZeeKing/aoc-2023) - my solutions for most of advent of code 2023. I only made it to day 17, but I am still extremely proud of some of the solutions I came up with.
- [C++ book for undergraduate CS Majors](https://codeberg.org/OpenBookProject/cppbook4ugcsm) - a book I'm helping my current computer science teacher write
